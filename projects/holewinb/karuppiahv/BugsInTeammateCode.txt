Card          Bug Found
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Smithy        Smithy card draws 4 cards into the player's hand from the deck
              rather than 3 as originally designed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adventurer    The Adventurer card never draws additional treasure cards. The
              Adventurer card is supposed to be able to pull cards from the deck
              until the player has two additional treasure cards in their hand.
              However, this does not appear to ever happen.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
village       The village card's bug is that it adds far more actions to the
              player than originally designed. It's supposed to only add two
              actions but this bug adds twelve.
